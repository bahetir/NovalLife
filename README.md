[Noval Life App deployed to Heroku](https://react-noval-life.herokuapp.com/)

## Introduction

This assignment focuses on understanding the application of usability and design principles for creating the overall look-and-feel of a web applicationâ€™s UI. It is all about front end part without backend supports.

## Design justifications

This project uses ReactJS, Ant Design, and Mapbox to implement the web application about covid-19. It contains 4 main pages: landing(home), login/registration, latest updates and help which are chosen by everyone in our group25. I designed the web application mainly based on my assignment1 lo-Fidelity Prototype, only changes the user icon to the upper-right corner to make user management function accessible. Also, I added a map display on the help page, trying to make the application more interactive with users.
